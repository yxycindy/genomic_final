# Getting started
Run tests
`pytest`


# TODO 

1. Edit distance correlation. In `edit_distance_correlation.py`, generate a bunch of random strings and measure their true edit distances and similarities according to MinHash, Weighted MinHash, and Order MinHash. Make a scatter plot (estimated similarity vs true edit distance).

2. Function to compute similarity between two trees. We could compute similarity using the following formula: number of edges shared between estimated tree and ground truth tree / numnber of edges in ground truth tree. Compute these scores on synthetic data.

3. Compute trees for Order MinHash and Weighted MinHash on Avianbase and synthetic data.

4. Compare Avianbase trees with BirdTree.org

5. Write better readme. In particular, instructions about how to run code (+ unit tests).

6. Write paper!
